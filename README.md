# SynchonizationProblem

The system is described by the figure given in “Graphical Representation.png” file.

It’s about 3 carts Ci (i=1,2,3) shifting with different speeds between Ai and Bi points.

Initialy, all of them are in Ai (in A1, A2 and A3 respectively).

When we push the buton M on, we would like that the carts make a round trip between Ai and Bi. 
In addition, the first cart arriving to Bi have to wait for the arrival of at least one other cart to Bj (j≠i). 
Then the two carts go back to Ai simultaniously.

No conditions are set to the lagging behind cart e.i. when it arrives to Bi, it goes back to Ai immediately.
